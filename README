This is a repository for the custom R# plugins that I build for my work needs.

If you want to contribute something and/or steal something, feel free.  The license, 
as far as I'm concerned, on this code is non-existent.  I don't care what you do 
with this code.  If you want to tell me what you did, if you fork it, I'd definitely 
appreciate any tips you have, etc., but you are not required to tell me anything.
